# Quantifying Security Risk

Quantitative security is a field of research that applies mathematical and statistical methods to the study of cybersecurity. It aims to quantify and model security risks, vulnerabilities, and impacts, providing a more objective and measurable approach to security management. Quantitative security can be used to assess the effectiveness of security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and predict the impact of security incidents. It can also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of security policies and procedures.

In the context of software design, quantitative security can be used to quantify the economic risk of a system. This involves modeling the system's behavior and then using statistical methods to analyze the data generated by the model. The results can be used to identify vulnerabilities and predict the impact of security incidents.

Risk is understood as
$$
risk = impact * likelihood
$$
where impact is the cost of exploitation and likelihood is the probability of exploitation.

for example
```rust ignore
pub fn calculate_impact(consequences: Vec<f64>, weights: Option<Vec<f64>>) -> f64 {
    let weights = match weights {
        Some(w) => w,
        None => vec![1.0; consequences.len()],  // If no weights are provided, assume equal importance
    };
    consequences.iter().zip(weights.iter()).map(|(c, w)| c * w).sum()
}

// Example: Data loss (e.g., $5000), downtime (e.g., 10 hours), reputational damage (e.g., 7 on a scale of 10)
let consequences = vec![5000.0, 10.0, 7.0];
let weights = Some(vec![0.5, 0.3, 0.2]);  // Weights reflecting the relative importance of each consequence
let impact = calculate_impact(consequences, weights);
println!("{}", impact);  // Outputs: 2535.0
```

and calculating the likelihood of exploitation is a function of its historical frequency, threat capability, control effectiveness, and environment factor. All of whih are between zero and one. Where threat capability is a metric quantifying threat actor sophistication and resources, controdl effectiveness is a metric quantifying the effectiveness of security controls, and environment factor is a metric quantifying the security of the environment in which the system operates.

```rust ignore
fn calculate_likelihood(historical_frequency: f64, threat_capability: f64, control_effectiveness: f64, environment_factor: f64) -> f64 {
    historical_frequency * threat_capability * (1.0 - control_effectiveness) * environment_factor
}

fn main() {
    // Example: High historical frequency (e.g., 0.8), high threat capability (e.g., 0.9), medium control effectiveness (e.g., 0.5), high environment factor (e.g., 1.0)
    let likelihood = calculate_likelihood(0.8, 0.9, 0.5, 1.0);
    println!("{}", likelihood);  // Outputs: 0.36
}
```

## Economic Risk

Economic risk in the context of finance can be quantified by considering various factors such as:

- **Market Risk**: This is the risk of investments declining in value because of economic developments or other events that affect the entire market. For example, the risk of a decline in the stock market.

- **Credit Risk**: This is the risk that a borrower will not repay a loan according to the terms of the loan, resulting in a loss to the lender. For example, the risk of a company defaulting on its bonds.

- **Operational Risk**: This is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems, or from external events. For example, the risk of a data breach due to inadequate cybersecurity measures.

- **Liquidity Risk**: This is the risk that an investor will not be able to sell an investment when they wish because of a lack of buyers in the market. For example, the risk of not being able to sell real estate quickly at a fair price.

These risks can be quantified using various financial models and statistical methods. For example, Value at Risk (VaR) is a commonly used measure to quantify market risk. It estimates the potential loss that could occur on an investment, given a certain level of confidence and time horizon.

Credit risk can be quantified using credit scoring models like the Altman Z-score, which predict the probability of a company going bankrupt. Operational risk can be quantified using methods like loss distribution approach (LDA), where the frequency and severity of losses are modeled to estimate the total loss. Liquidity risk can be quantified using measures like the bid-ask spread or the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).

It's important to note that these are just examples and the actual quantification of economic risk in finance is a complex process that requires a deep understanding of financial theories and statistical models.
