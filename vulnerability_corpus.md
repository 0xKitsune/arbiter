# Vulnerability Corpus

Here is a running list of vulnerabilities that have been found with Arbiter. This list is not exhaustive, but it is a good starting point for understanding how to use Arbiter to find vulnerablities. Arbiter has a unique ability to detect anomaly behavior in a production like environment. This can be used to audit mechanism design in smart contract systems as well as detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

## Vulnerabilities

## Rating System 

**Low**: Includes both Non-critical (code style, clarity, syntax, versioning, off-chain monitoring (events, etc) and Low risk (e.g. assets are not at risk: state handling, function incorrect as to spec, issues with comments). 

**Med**: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements.

**High**: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals). These are considered critical issues that should be addressed immediately.

This criteria is based on the [Code4rena](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/judging-criteria/severity-categorization) judging criteria.

## Contributing to the Corpus

If you find any vulnerabilities with Arbiter, please submit a pull request to this file with the vulnerability and a description of the vulnerability, a link to the arbiter repo and post mortem and steps to reproduce. If the vulnerability is in the wild and has not yet been patched, please do your best to work with the team responsible for the vulnerablity to resolve the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly.
